Logic Building Task – 1

Internship Assignment 

📌 Project Description
This repository contains a series of Python scripts designed to solve common logical problems. The goal of this task is to demonstrate clean coding practices, efficient use of loops, and basic data processing techniques.

📋 Task Breakdown
1. User Login Check
Goal: Simulate a secure login system.

Logic: Compares input credentials against a stored username and password using conditional statements.

Outcome: Displays success for matching credentials and an error for mismatches.

2. Pass / Fail Analyzer
Goal: Automate academic result evaluation.

Logic: Iterates through a list of scores and categorizes them based on a passing threshold of 50.

Outcome: Provides a final tally of total passes and total failures.

3. Simple Data Cleaner
Goal: Standardize "messy" user-submitted data.

Logic: Removes leading/trailing whitespace and converts strings to lowercase.

Outcome: A consistent, clean list of names ready for database storage.

4. Message Length Analyzer
Goal: Monitor text size for platform constraints.

Logic: Calculates the character count of each message and flags entries that exceed a 10-character limit.

Outcome: Identification of "Long Messages" for further validation.

5. Error Message Detector
Goal: Scan system logs for critical failures.

Logic: Filters a list of log entries specifically to identify and count "ERROR" tags.

Outcome: Quick detection of system issues from raw text data.

🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
Conditional Logic: if, else, and and operators.

Loops: Iterating through lists using for.

String Manipulation: .strip(), .lower(), and len().

Counters: Accumulating data within a loop.

🚀 How to Use
Open the Python file (task1.py).

Run the script in any Python 3.x environment.

Observe the formatted output in the terminal.
